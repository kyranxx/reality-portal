# Firebase Integration Fixes

## Issues Addressed

1. **Race Condition in Firebase Initialization**

   - Problem: Firebase services were being directly exported as module variables before initialization completed
   - Symptom: `"Error fetching properties: Error: Firestore is not initialized"` despite logs showing successful initialization
   - Fix: Added initialization promise pattern with proper async/await support

2. **Server Component & Firebase Conflict**

   - Problem: React Server Components were trying to use client-side Firebase code
   - Symptom: Multiple 422 errors for property pages with URLs ending in `?_rsc=1wtp7`
   - Fix: Created proper client/server boundary with server-side static fallbacks

3. **Missing Initialization Guards**
   - Problem: Inconsistent use of initialization guards across the codebase
   - Fix: Implemented a unified Firebase Provider with proper initialization state tracking

## Key Changes

### 1. Firebase Initialization Guard

Created a robust initialization system in `firebase.ts`:

- Added `waitForFirebaseInit()` to safely wait for Firebase to be ready
- Made initialization promise-based with proper error handling
- Removed dependency on auth being ready before initializing other services

### 2. Client-side Firebase Provider

Added `FirebaseProvider.tsx` to provide React context for Firebase state:

- Tracks initialization state for components to reference
- Provides loading fallbacks during initialization
- Ensures proper error handling for Firebase operations

### 3. Unified Property Data Service

Created `propertyService.ts` to handle data fetching with fallbacks:

- Tries Firestore first with proper error handling
- Falls back to static sample data when needed
- Handles server/client boundary with isomorphic data model

### 4. Server Property Provider

Added `ServerPropertyProvider.tsx` for server components:

- Only uses static data for server rendering
- Avoids any client-side Firebase imports
- Prevents serialization errors in React Server Components

### 5. Improved Property Pages

Rewrote property pages to handle both server and client rendering:

- Server page provides static data as fallback
- Client component hydrates with Firebase data when available
- Proper loading states and error handling

## Architecture Improvements

- **Clear Server/Client Boundary**: Proper separation between server and client code
- **Fallback Strategy**: Static data used when Firebase is not available
- **Unified Data Model**: Consistent property interface across server and client
- **Error Recovery**: Multiple layers of error handling and fallbacks
- **Initialization Guards**: All Firebase operations now wait for initialization

## Future Considerations

1. Consider using Next.js middleware to handle authentication state
2. Implement React Query or SWR for more robust data fetching
3. Add proper error tracking and reporting
4. Prefetch commonly accessed data to reduce database calls
