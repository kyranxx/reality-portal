# Firebase Authentication Import Fix

## Issue

The Vercel deployment was failing with the following errors:

```
Attempted import error: 'createUserWithEmailAndPassword' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'signInWithEmailAndPassword' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'GoogleAuthProvider' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'signInWithPopup' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'signOut' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'sendPasswordResetEmail' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'getAuth' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
```

These errors occurred in:

- `src/utils/FirebaseAuthContext.tsx`
- `src/utils/firebase.ts`

## Root Cause

The project was using Firebase v11.4.0, but in this version, the authentication functions are no longer exported directly from 'firebase/auth'. Instead, they are moved to '@firebase/auth'.

## Solution

Downgraded Firebase to version 10.7.0, which maintains the original import structure:

```bash
npm install firebase@10.7.0 --save
```

With Firebase v10.7.0, all authentication functions can be imported directly from 'firebase/auth' as before:

```typescript
import {
  User,
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword,
  signInWithEmailAndPassword,
  signOut as firebaseSignOut,
  onAuthStateChanged,
  GoogleAuthProvider,
  signInWithPopup,
  sendPasswordResetEmail,
  Auth,
} from 'firebase/auth';
```

## Alternative Solution

If you need to use Firebase v11.x in the future, you'll need to update the imports to use '@firebase/auth' instead:

```typescript
import { User, onAuthStateChanged, Auth } from 'firebase/auth';
import {
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword,
  signInWithEmailAndPassword,
  signOut as firebaseSignOut,
  GoogleAuthProvider,
  signInWithPopup,
  sendPasswordResetEmail,
} from '@firebase/auth';
```

And in firebase.ts:

```typescript
import { getAuth, connectAuthEmulator } from '@firebase/auth';
```

## Verification

After downgrading Firebase to v10.7.0, the build completed successfully without any import errors.
