# Firebase Authentication Import Fix

## Issue

The Vercel deployment was failing with the following errors:

```
Attempted import error: 'createUserWithEmailAndPassword' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'signInWithEmailAndPassword' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'GoogleAuthProvider' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'signInWithPopup' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'signOut' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'sendPasswordResetEmail' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
Attempted import error: 'getAuth' is not exported from 'firebase/auth'
```

These errors occurred in:

- `src/utils/FirebaseAuthContext.tsx`
- `src/utils/firebase.ts`

## Root Cause

The project was using Firebase v11.4.0, but in this version, the authentication functions are no longer exported directly from 'firebase/auth'. Instead, they are moved to '@firebase/auth'.

## Initial Solution

Downgraded Firebase to version 10.7.0, which maintains the original import structure:

```bash
npm install firebase@10.7.0 --save
```

With Firebase v10.7.0, all authentication functions can be imported directly from 'firebase/auth' as before:

```typescript
import {
  User,
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword,
  signInWithEmailAndPassword,
  signOut as firebaseSignOut,
  onAuthStateChanged,
  GoogleAuthProvider,
  signInWithPopup,
  sendPasswordResetEmail,
  Auth,
} from 'firebase/auth';
```

## Enhanced Solution for Vercel Deployment

The initial solution worked locally but not in the Vercel deployment environment. To fix this, we implemented two additional changes:

1. Updated the imports to use '@firebase/auth' for the authentication functions:

```typescript
import { User, onAuthStateChanged, Auth } from 'firebase/auth';
import {
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword,
  signInWithEmailAndPassword,
  signOut as firebaseSignOut,
  GoogleAuthProvider,
  signInWithPopup,
  sendPasswordResetEmail,
} from '@firebase/auth';
```

And in firebase.ts:

```typescript
import { getAuth, connectAuthEmulator } from '@firebase/auth';
```

2. Modified the build-vercel.js script to explicitly install Firebase v10.7.0 during the Vercel build process:

```javascript
// Ensure correct Firebase version is installed
console.log('Ensuring correct Firebase version...');
execSync('npm install firebase@10.7.0 --save', { stdio: 'inherit' });
```

This ensures that the correct version of Firebase is used during the Vercel build, regardless of what's specified in package.json.

## Verification

After implementing these changes, the build should complete successfully without any import errors. The combination of using the correct import paths and ensuring the right Firebase version is installed during the build process provides a robust solution to the authentication import issues.
