# Console Errors Fixes (March 2025)

This document details the solutions implemented to resolve the console errors found in the Reality Portal application. The fixes address critical issues with Firebase initialization, image loading, and authentication, providing more robust error handling and improved user experience.

## 1. Firebase Auth Race Condition

**Problem:**

```
vendors-28727f0cc55b0184.js:1 Failed to load Firebase Auth: Error: Component auth has not been registered yet
```

**Root Cause:**

- Firebase Auth module was being accessed before it was fully loaded and registered
- Asynchronous module loading race condition causing components to try using auth before initialization was complete

**Solution:**

- Implemented waitForAuthModule in firebase-auth-unified.ts to track auth module loading state
- Modified firebase.ts to wait for auth module loading before initializing auth
- Enhanced firebase-init-guard.ts to dynamically import firebase module if services aren't available
- Created a more robust initialization sequence with proper dependency chain

## 2. Firestore Permissions Error

**Problem:**

```
vendors-28727f0cc55b0184.js:1 Error fetching properties: FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**Root Cause:**

- Firebase auth initialization issues resulting in unauthenticated requests
- Firestore operations attempted before authentication was completed

**Solution:**

- Enhanced firestore-error-handler.ts with robust retry mechanism
- Implemented comprehensive error type handling with specific recovery strategies
- Added token refresh mechanism for authentication errors
- Created ensureFirebaseReady function with multiple fallback strategies

## 3. Image Loading Issues

**Problem:**

```
GET https://reality-portal-8vxyoya0z-daniels-projects-98c0558b.vercel.app/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Flogo.svg&w=1920&q=75 422 (Unprocessable Content)
Image failed to load: /images/logo.svg, using fallback
```

**Root Cause:**

- SVG format incompatibility with Next.js Image component
- Incorrect image paths and missing fallback mechanisms

**Solution:**

- Enhanced SafeImage component with SVG format detection
- Implemented retry mechanism for failed image loads
- Added cache-busting for network errors
- Fallback to regular img tag for SVGs that fail with Next.js Image component

## 4. Third-Party Cookie Warnings

**Problem:**

```
Chrome is moving towards a new experience that allows users to choose to browse without third-party cookies.
```

**Root Cause:**

- Firebase authentication relying on third-party cookies that modern browsers block
- No first-party cookie fallback for authentication tokens

**Solution:**

- Created auth-cookie-handler.ts to manage authentication with first-party cookies
- Implemented token storage in both cookies and localStorage for redundancy
- Modified FirebaseAuthContext to store tokens when user is authenticated
- Added configureAuthForFirstPartyCookies function for browser compatibility

## 5. Google API Errors

**Problem:**

```
[ERROR] Error from apiError: API Error: 0 for https://apis.google.com/js/gen_204?c=50%3A1
```

**Root Cause:**

- Google API errors during Firebase authentication process
- Missing domain authorization for OAuth operations

**Solution:**

- Added better error handling for Google API calls in FirebaseAuthContext
- Implemented first-party token storage to reduce reliance on Google's cookie system
- Enhanced error reporting with specific error types and user-friendly messages

## 6. Fetch Failures

**Problem:**

```
Fetch failed loading: GET "https://reality-portal-8vxyoya0z-daniels-projects-98c0558b.vercel.app/kontakt?_rsc=1wtp7".
```

**Root Cause:**

- Network issues and resource loading failures
- Authentication errors cascading into fetch failures

**Solution:**

- Fixed underlying authentication issues preventing proper resource loading
- Improved error handling for fetch operations in firestore-error-handler.ts
- Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient network errors

## Implementation Summary

The fixes follow a layered approach:

1. **Core Authentication Layer**

   - Fixed Firebase Auth initialization sequence
   - Implemented first-party cookie authentication storage
   - Added robust error handling and recovery

2. **Data Access Layer**

   - Enhanced Firestore error handling with retries
   - Added fallback data mechanisms for offline/error scenarios
   - Improved error logging and reporting

3. **UI Components Layer**
   - Fixed image loading with better format detection
   - Implemented automatic retries for transient errors
   - Added fallback rendering options for problematic formats

These changes ensure the application is more resilient to initialization race conditions, network errors, and browser security restrictions, resulting in a more reliable user experience.
