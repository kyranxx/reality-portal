# Image Loading Fix

This guide explains the fixes implemented to resolve image loading issues in the Reality Portal application.

## Overview of Fixes

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to resolve several issues:

1. **Fixed Firebase Initialization Sequence**

   - Created a robust initialization guard pattern in `src/utils/firebase-init-guard.ts`
   - Ensures Firebase is properly initialized before components try to use its services

2. **Enhanced Image URL Processing**

   - Created the `src/utils/image-utils.ts` utility to handle various image URL formats
   - Added special handling for Firebase Storage URLs
   - Implemented local fallbacks for when Firebase is unavailable

3. **Improved SafeImage Component**

   - Enhanced error handling with better fallbacks
   - Added support for property type-specific placeholder selection
   - Made it compatible with different image source formats

4. **Configured Environment**
   - Created `.env.local` with placeholder Firebase configuration
   - Added flag to enable local image fallbacks for development

## Local Development

For local development with proper image handling:

1. Make sure `.env.local` is properly configured with either:

   - Real Firebase credentials if you want to use actual Firebase Storage
   - The included placeholders with `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_FALLBACKS=true` to use local fallbacks

2. When using local fallbacks, the system will generate appropriate property-type images based on the type of property being displayed.

## Remaining Firebase Errors

You will still see some Firebase errors in the console related to:

1. **Auth Initialization**: These are normal when using placeholder credentials
2. **Firestore Permissions**: These occur because the Firebase project isn't properly configured

These errors don't affect the application's functionality when using local fallbacks.

## Custom Image Placeholders

To add your own placeholder images:

1. Create the following folders:

   ```
   public/images/samples/apartment-1.jpg
   public/images/samples/apartment-2.jpg
   public/images/samples/apartment-3.jpg
   public/images/samples/house-1.jpg
   public/images/samples/house-2.jpg
   public/images/samples/house-3.jpg
   public/images/samples/land-1.jpg
   public/images/samples/land-2.jpg
   public/images/samples/land-3.jpg
   public/images/samples/commercial-1.jpg
   public/images/samples/commercial-2.jpg
   public/images/samples/commercial-3.jpg
   ```

2. Place appropriate image files in these locations.

3. For a generic placeholder, add an image at `public/images/placeholder.jpg`

## Setting Up Real Firebase Storage

To completely fix the Firebase errors:

1. Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication and Storage
3. Update the Storage rules to allow public read access:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /{allPaths=**} {
         allow read;
         allow write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Update `.env.local` with your real Firebase configuration values
5. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_FALLBACKS=false` to use real Firebase Storage

## Troubleshooting

If images still fail to load:

1. Check the browser console for specific errors
2. Verify that the image URLs in your database are correctly formatted
3. Ensure Firebase Storage permissions are correctly set
4. Try setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_FALLBACKS=true` temporarily
