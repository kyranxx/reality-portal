# Reality Portal Project Tracker

## Phase 1: Initial Development and Setup âœ…

- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- Implement basic UI components and layout
- Add Firebase authentication
- Create initial property listing functionality
- Set up multilingual support framework
- Deploy to Vercel

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Improvements ðŸ”„

### Completed Issues âœ…

1. **Firebase Authentication Initialization**: Fixed race conditions and component registration issues

   - Added isInitialized() method to firebase-service.ts
   - Implemented wait mechanisms with timeouts
   - Created comprehensive error handling

2. **Property Detail Page Implementation**: Replaced generic "Page Content" placeholder for property pages

   - Created PropertyDetailClient component with proper error states
   - Updated page-fixed.tsx to use the new component
   - Added proper client/server boundaries

3. **Language Default and Translation Integration**: Set up Slovak as default language
   - Set DEFAULT_LANGUAGE to 'sk' in AppContext
   - Integrated translation-fixes.ts with AppContext
   - Added validation for translation completeness

### Remaining Issues ðŸ”„

1. **Mixed Language Content**: Slovak and English text still appearing inconsistently in some areas
2. **Server-Side Rendering Placeholders**: Non-property pages still displaying "Page Content" placeholder
3. **Firebase Permission Errors**: Console still shows permission and resource loading errors

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Language Consistency Fixes (Remaining)

**WHY**: The application currently displays a mix of Slovak and English content, creating a confusing user experience. This happens because:

- Translation system isn't properly integrated with AppContext
- Slovak content appears in English interface and vice-versa
- Translation-fixes.ts utility was created but not fully implemented

**COMPLETED**:

- âœ… Integrated translation-fixes.ts with AppContext.tsx
- âœ… Set Slovak (sk) as the default language
- âœ… Added runtime translation validation for development

**REMAINING TASKS**:

- **Create LanguageRestrictor Component**: This will enforce language setting restrictions by intercepting and preventing language changes outside admin dashboard

  - Create new file `src/components/LanguageRestrictor.tsx`
  - Wrap app with this component to enforce language rules
  - Implement logic to redirect language change attempts to admin dashboard
  - WHY: Currently any component can change the language, causing inconsistent UI

- **Update Header Component**: Remove language selector from public-facing header

  - Modify `src/components/Header.tsx` to hide language selection for non-admin users
  - Add visual indication of current language without change option
  - WHY: Public users currently see all language options, causing accidental language mixing

- **Complete Translation Keys**: Audit and fix all untranslated texts
  - Run validation on all common.json files to identify missing keys
  - Add all missing translations, especially in Czech and Hungarian files
  - Fix inconsistent translations between languages
  - WHY: Even with translation system in place, some keys are still missing or inconsistent

#### 2. Server-Side Rendering Implementation (Remaining)

**WHY**: While property detail pages now work correctly, several pages still show the generic "Page Content" placeholder:

- Category pages (byty, domy, pozemky, komercne)
- Content pages (o-nas, kontakt)
- These pages need client components to properly function with SSR

**COMPLETED**:

- âœ… Created PropertyDetailClient component for property pages
- âœ… Updated ClientComponentLoader to load the new component
- âœ… Fixed property detail page rendering

**REMAINING TASKS**:

- **Create CategoryClient Component**: For property category pages

  - Create `src/app/nehnutelnosti/[category]/CategoryClient.tsx`
  - Implement fetching of properties by category type
  - Add filtering and sorting functionality
  - Update `_components.tsx` to register this component
  - WHY: Category pages currently show placeholder instead of property listings

- **Create ContactClient and AboutClient Components**: For content pages

  - Create `src/app/kontakt/ContactClient.tsx` and `src/app/o-nas/AboutClient.tsx`
  - Add proper content rendering with translation support
  - Update `_components.tsx` to register these components
  - WHY: Contact and About pages show placeholder text instead of actual content

- **Update Base Server Page Fallbacks**: Improve placeholder appearance
  - Modify `src/app/base-server-page.tsx` to show better loading states
  - Add more descriptive error messages when components fail to load
  - WHY: Current fallback is too generic and doesn't help users understand what's happening

#### 3. Firebase Error Resolution (Remaining)

**WHY**: Even with initialization improvements, users still experience Firebase errors:

- Permission errors appear in console ("Missing or insufficient permissions")
- Resource loading failures (400 errors) occur for images and Firestore resources
- Security rules aren't being properly applied in production

**COMPLETED**:

- âœ… Added initialization guards in firebase-service.ts
- âœ… Created comprehensive error handling for Firebase operations
- âœ… Created Firestore security rules file

**REMAINING TASKS**:

- **Deploy Firebase Rules**: Push security rules to production

  - Create deployment script for rules in `scripts/deploy-firebase-rules.js`
  - Add validation to ensure rules are properly deployed
  - Document the deployment process for future reference
  - WHY: Rules exist locally but haven't been deployed to Firebase, causing permission errors

- **Create Robust Image Handling**: Fix 400 errors on images

  - Create actual placeholder image (not just a text file)
  - Update SafeImage component to handle all error cases
  - Implement image preloading for critical images
  - WHY: Missing images cause UI issues and console errors that interrupt user experience

- **Improve Firebase Offline Support**: Handle disconnected states
  - Add offline detection and user notification
  - Implement local caching for frequent Firestore queries
  - Create retry mechanism for failed Firebase operations
  - WHY: Network issues currently cause visible errors instead of graceful fallbacks

#### 4. Testing and Validation Process (Remaining)

**WHY**: Comprehensive testing is needed to ensure all fixes work together and cover all edge cases:

- Each fix may interact with others in unexpected ways
- Edge cases like slow networks or missing resources need testing
- Clear validation processes help prevent regression

**COMPLETED**:

- âœ… Manual testing of property detail pages
- âœ… Basic Firebase initialization validation
- âœ… Development-time translation validation

**REMAINING TASKS**:

- **Create End-to-End Test Suite**: Validate core user journeys

  - Create `scripts/e2e-tests.js` with Puppeteer tests for core user flows
  - Test all language combinations
  - Test Firebase authentication flows with various connection speeds
  - WHY: Manual testing can't cover all usage scenarios consistently

- **Implement Network Resilience Tests**: Validate behavior under poor conditions

  - Add network throttling tests
  - Test Firebase operations during intermittent connectivity
  - Create simulated permission error scenarios
  - WHY: Many Firebase errors only appear under specific network conditions

- **Document Test Scenarios**: Create comprehensive test documentation
  - Create `docs/testing-guide.md` with all test scenarios
  - Include screenshots of expected behavior
  - Add troubleshooting section for common test failures
  - WHY: Future developers need clear testing guidance to maintain quality

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:

- All changes should be minimal and focused on specific issues
- Keep existing architecture intact wherever possible
- Language switching should ONLY be available in admin dashboard
- Default language should be Slovak unless admin explicitly changes it
- Some Firebase errors will persist until rules are properly deployed
- Each component must handle its own loading and error states

## Phase 3: Feature Expansion ðŸ”œ

- Add advanced property search functionality
- Implement messaging system between users
- Add property favoriting and saved searches
- Create admin dashboard for content management
- Implement analytics tracking

## Phase 4: Optimization and Polish ðŸ“…

- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Mobile responsiveness refinement
- SEO optimization
- Final design polish
