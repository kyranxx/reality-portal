# TailwindCSS Forms Plugin Fix

## Issue

The Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:

```
Error: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/forms'
Require stack:
- /vercel/path0/tailwind.config.js
```

This occurred because the `@tailwindcss/forms` package was listed as a devDependency in package.json, but it's required by tailwind.config.js during the build process.

## Solution

Two changes were implemented to fix this issue:

### 1. Moved @tailwindcss/forms from devDependencies to dependencies

Updated package.json to include @tailwindcss/forms in the regular dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@next/bundle-analyzer": "^15.2.2",
  "@tailwindcss/forms": "^0.5.10",
  "autoprefixer": "^10.4.16",
  "firebase": "^10.7.0",
  "next": "^14.1.0",
  "null-loader": "^4.0.1",
  "postcss": "^8.4.32",
  "puppeteer": "^24.4.0",
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0"
}
```

### 2. Made tailwind.config.js more robust with conditional plugin loading

Modified tailwind.config.js to conditionally load the @tailwindcss/forms plugin:

```javascript
plugins: [
  // Try to load @tailwindcss/forms, but continue if it's not available
  (function() {
    try {
      return require('@tailwindcss/forms');
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn('Warning: @tailwindcss/forms not found, form styling disabled');
      return {};
    }
  })(),
],
```

This provides a fallback in case the package is not available, making the configuration more robust.

## Why This Fix Works

1. Moving `@tailwindcss/forms` to dependencies ensures it's installed during the Vercel build process, even if devDependencies are skipped.
2. The conditional loading in tailwind.config.js adds an extra layer of protection, allowing the build to continue even if there are issues with the plugin.

## Verification

After implementing these changes, the Vercel build should complete successfully without the "Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/forms'" error.
